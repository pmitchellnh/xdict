    <div id="overview"><h2><li>Overview</h2>
        XDict is a database tool designed to facilitate the creation and maintenance of
        a crossword puzzle dictionary.  It was designed and continues to be maintained
        by a crossword puzzle constructor for personal use, and its features are
        born from the actual needs and pains of trying to maintain word lists through
        existing crossword construction tools (Crossword Compiler, Crossfire) or other
        non-crossword-specific applications (Word, Excel, text files).

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="config"><h3><li>Configuration</h3>
        Before you start, copy (or rename, if you don't care to save the original) the "config.orig"
        file to "config.txt". Then modify the config.txt file as desired.<p>
        <div class="note">Note:<p>
          If config.txt is not found, config.orig will be used.  If neither is found, the program
          will abort.
        </div><p>
        Parameters in the config.txt file can be used to customize certain parameters, as follows:

      </div>
      <div id="runit"><h3><li>Running the Program</h3>
        Open a terminal window in the target directory where you unzipped the XDict.zip file, in
        <a href="#install">Installing the Software</a>, above. Run the following command:<p>
          <pre>java -jar XDict.jar</pre>
      <div id="testmode"><h3><li>Test Mode</h3>
        Test Mode provides all the functionality of "production" mode, but uses <i>temporary tables</i>,
        so <i>no data is preserved when you exit the program</i>. This allows you to fully experiment with
        all of the features of the program without worrying about accuracy or corruption of "real" data.
        <p>
        <div class="note">
          Note that the program starts in TEST_MODE by default after installation.
          See <a href="#config">Configuration</a>, above, for details on disabling Test Mode.
        </div><p>
        <div class="tip">Tip:<p>
          I <i>highly</i> recommend playing around in Test Mode to get a feel for how things word before
          starting to load and modify your production data.  Even after you enter production mode, you can
          always restart the program in Test Mode to try something that you are unsure of.
        </div><p>
        <div class="tip">Tip:<p>
          Even though Test Mode uses temporary tables, you can still run a backup of the Test Mode
          database and restore it in another Test Mode session. There is a mechanism built in to prevent
          the accidental restoring of a Test Mode database into the production system.  See
          <a href="#restore">Restore</a> for details.

      <div id="parameters"><h3><li>Metadata Parameter Settings</h3>
      <img src="./images/Parameters.png" alt="Parameters" width="700px"><p>
        These settings are used to query on or set various metadata parameters.  Not all parameters
        are applicable in certain modes.  How each is used in each mode is discussed in detail in the

      </div>
      <div id="actions"><h3><li>Action Buttons</h3>
      <img src="./images/Actions.png" alt="Action Buttons" width="700px"><p>
        Each action mode has different action buttons associated with it.  The default action (which
        occurs if you just hit the Enter key) at any given time is the button that is colored blue.
      <div class="note">Note:<p>
        The default action may change as appropriate, as described in the sections below.
      </div><p>
      </div>
      <div id="modes"><h3><li>Action Mode Tabs</h3>
      <img src="./images/ModeTabs.png" alt="Action Tabs" width="700px"><p>
      The Action Mode Tabs control the type of major action you are doing.  Each action will
      set certain default parameter values, based on how one is most likely to use that mode.
      See the sections on each action for details. The action modes are:<p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#query"><b>Query:</b></a> Find entries in your database based on specific criteria.
        <li><a href="#add"><b>Add:</b></a> Manually add, modify, and/or rate single entries to your database.
        <li><a href="#rate"><b>Rate:</b></a> Rate lists of words quickly, using preset buttons.
        <li><a href="#load"><b>Load:</b></a> Load rated or unrated word lists into your database.
        <li><a href="#export"><b>Export:</b></a> Create dictionary files to use with your constructing software.

      </div>
      <div id="results"><h3><li>Display Area</h3>
      <img src="./images/Results.png" alt="Display Area" width="700px"><p>
        The display area is where query results and other messages are shown, and where the rating
        takes place. It becomes a scrollable region when necessary.
      </div>
      <div id="statusbar"><h3><li>Status Bar</h3>
      <img src="./images/Status.png" alt="Status Bar" width="700px"><p>
        The status bar shows the progress and status of actions.
      </div>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="query"><h2><li>Querying the Database</h2>
      <img src="./images/MainScreen.png" alt="Query Screen" width="700px"><p>
      The Query tab provides a robust query interface to view your database.  All of the metadata
      parameters can be used to constrain the query, with the exception of "Comments".  There is no
      current mechanism to query based on the contents of the Comments field.<p>
      For large queries, be aware that the system only returns up to 1000 entries per request. For
      queries that have more than 1000 entries in the result set, use the "Next" button (which will
      become the default action) to view the next 1000 entries.  You can continue using the "Next"
      action until the result set is empty. Note that your progress through the list is displayed
      in the status bar.<p>
      <img src="./images/QueryStatus1.png" alt="Query Status" width="500px"><p>
      <img src="./images/QueryStatus2.png" alt="Query Status" width="480px"><p>
      <ol type='A'>
      <div id="queryentry"><h3><li>Entry Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/EntryControl.png" alt="Entry Control" width="500px"><p>
        The Entry control allows you to constrain the result to match a particular pattern
        of letters. You can specify whether you want the pattern to exactly match (Equals),
        match the beginning of (Starts with), or match anywhere in (Contains) an entry in
        your database.<p>
        Note that, while database entries are all stored in upper case, the entry field is
        not case-sensitive.
        <div class="tip">Tip:<p>
          The entry field will accept '?' or '_' characters as single-character wildcards.
          For example, an Equals query on  "a?t?d" (or "a_t_d") might match ACTED, ANTED, or APTED.
        </div><p>
        <div class="tip">Tip:<p>
          Any query for an exact entry string (an "Equals" search of at least one character with no wildcards)
          will search for that string <i>ignoring any other parameters that may be set</i>. This is
          because when you just want to know whether a word is or is not in your database, you don't
          want to have to guess what the other parameters might or might not be.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="querylength"><h3><li>Length Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/LengthControl.png" alt="Length Control" width="500px"><p>
        The Length control allows you to constrain the result to match a particular length,
        a minimum length, or a maximum length.  The default is "at least 3", which returns
        all lengths (since the database does not store entries less than 3-letters long).
        Other examples: "At most 15" would show entries between 3- and 15-letters long, while
        "Equals 7" would show only entries that are exactly 7-letters long.
      </div>
      <div id="querymethod"><h3><li>Rating Method Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/RatingMethod.png" alt="Rating Method Control" width="300px"><p>
        The Rating Method control allows you to select based on how words have been rated. The
        software supports three tiers of rating:
        <dl>
          <dt>Auto-loaded
            <dd>Words loaded with a default value from unrated word lists (or with an invalid or unparseable
              value from an otherwise rated word list). These words have the lowest

        equal to a particular rating value.  This is useful when looking for highly-rated
        words that match a particular pattern, for instance.  When in the "Rating" mode,
        it can be used to target words that are currently highly or poorly rated. The default

      <div id="queryoutput"><h3><li>Query Output Display</h3>
        The query output displays the results of the query (up to 1000 entries at a time, scrollable).
        The format for each entry is as follows:
        <p>
        WORD(LENGTH), RATING [, any] [, nyt] [, research] [,ranked | manual] [(COMMENT)]
        <p>
          where the fields in [] only appear if set.  For example, a "bare minimum" auto-loaded entry would
          display as follows (just WORD(LENGTH), RATING):
        <p>
          <img src="./images/QueryResult2.png" alt="Sample Query Result" width="400px"><p>
          whereas, an entry with all possible fields set would display like this:
          <p>
            <img src="./images/QueryResult1.png" alt="Sample Query Result" width="400px"><p>
          indicating that the entry is flagged as having been used in puzzles, including the NY Times,
          that it is flagged as needing research, that it has been hand-rated, and that it has a
          comment, which is displayed in parentheses.  Note that this example is for clarity only -- it
          would be unusual for both "research" and "manual" to be set on the same word, though it could
          happen if you chose to revisit a previously rated entry.
          <p>
          <div class="note">Note: <p>
            Rating method is either auto-loaded (absence of other indicator), rank-loaded ("ranked"), or
            hand-rated ("manual"). A rank-loaded word becomes "manual" once it has been hand-rated; the fact
            that it originally loaded from a ranked list is no longer relevant.

    <div id="add"><h2><li>Adding and Modifying Words</h2>
      <img src="./images/AddScreen1.png" alt="Add Screen" width="700px"><p>
      The Add tab allow you to quickly add or modify (and rate) single entries in your database. When
      adding a new word manually, you have no choice but to mark it "Hand-rated".  Likewise, you cannot
      specify the length, as that will be calculated after the word is cleared of all non-alphanumeric
      characters and converted to uppercase.  The default value for the Crossword Use control is "Not Used",
      as typically that is the case when adding new words manually, but you can change this value, add
      a comment, or select or designate a rating value (default preset is "OK" value), by setting them on the
      screen before pressing the "Add" button.
      <p>
      <div class="note">Note:<p>
        Comment lengths are limited to (and will be truncated to, if necessary) 100 characters.
      </div>
      <p>
      Note that, unlike in the Rating process, pressing a rating button will <i>not</i> immediately cause
      the word to be added.  The rating buttons are a convenience to set the Manual Slider based on
      your rating scale.  No action to the database will occur until you press the "Add" button. Once the
      word is added, it will display the formatted word and rating in the Display Area.
      <p>
      <img src="./images/AddScreen2.png" alt="Add Screen" width="700px"><p>
      Adding an entry that already exists will not fail; it will modify the existing word with the parameters
      specified.  In fact, as you are typing a word on the Add screen the software will query and update
      the existing parameters if that word (or those letters as they are currently typed) alreadty exists.
      It also changes the "Add" button text to "Modify".  This is done to prevent accidentally overwriting
      and erasing metadata from words that already exist without having to do a manual query first -- if
      the word exists, then the data on the screen matches what is there.  Of course, you can then change
      any of this data and press the "modify" button to override it<sup>*</sup>.
      <p>
      <img src="./images/AddScreen3.png" alt="Add Screen" width="700px"><p>
      <sup>*</sup>Obviously you cannot change length, as that is inherent to the word. Also, the Rating
      field in the upper section displays the existing rating -- changes to the rating are made with
      the rating buttons or Manual Rating slider.  This way, the existing rating will continue to
      be displayed, even while hitting rating buttons, until you have pressed the Modify button (or
      have left or changed the screen).

    <div id="rate"><h2><li>Rating Words</h2>
      <ol type='A'>
      <div id="ratingoverview"><h3><li>Rating Overview and Theory</h3>
        A lot of thought has been put into how to rate words quickly, efficiently,
        and intuitively.  Rating words is certainly not an exact science -- different
        people have different ideas about what determines the quality of an entry.
        Even one's own judgement may be inconsistent from day to day, based on mood
        or interpretation of a given entry.  This is especially true if one is assigning
        numerical scores.  As such, this software pushes the numerical values into the
        background (after being preset through configuration), allowing the user (you)
        to rate based entirely on your perception of the entry.  It does this by offering
        seven possible ratings<sup>*</sup> for each word, as follows:<p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Excellent:</b> These are marquee entries that you would go out of your way to use.
          <li><b>Good:</b> These are solid words and phrases that you would be happy to use.
          <li><b>OK:</b> These are common words and phrases that may lack pizzazz, but there's nothing wrong with them.
          <li><b>Meh:</b> These are below-average or slightly-flawed words or phrases that are okay,
            but not preferred. This might include certain plurals or gerunds, common abbreviations,
            common foreign words, common fill-the-blanks, or decent words that are severely limited in how they can be clued.
          <li><b>Lame:</b> These are words and phrases that you know you'll need, but want to minimize. I include
            many abbreviations, foreign words, fill-in-the-blank partials, and proper names that
            require specific/trivial knowledge, are of another generation, and/or would be difficult to
            deduce without very clear crossings.
          <li><b>Poor:</b> These are obscure entries that you would normally avoid, but might resort to in a pinch.
          <li><b>Nope:</b> This is used for non-words or words you have no intention of ever using.
            Sometimes a sequence of letters shows up in a word list from a rebus, a backwards entry, or
            some other quirky puzzle that was not filtered out. This can also be used to remove profanity,
            overly-scientific, obscure variations, etc.  This will assign the word a value of 0.
        </ul><p>
        <sup>*</sup>The rating values can vary by word length; see below. You can also rate a word manually,
        if you need more granularity for a given word.
        <p>
          <b>My theory on word length:</b> <p>
          I don't think it's a stretch to say that long entries carry a puzzle.  That is not to say that
          shorter entries are unimportant; they certainly matter.  But the long entries are the ones
          that your solvers (and editors) are going to notice.  Put another way, good long entries are
          better than good short entries, and bad long entries are worse than bad short entries. There
          is not a 3-letter entry in existence that is so good that it can make up for a bad long entry.
          It is not a huge exaggeration to say that almost any 3-letter entry could be justified in a
          pinch. To put it in mathematical terms, the standard deviation for long entries should, in my
          opinion, be considerably larger than for short entries.<p>
          This is why this software allows for the configuration of separate rating values for entries
          that are 3, 4, 5, and 6 letters long.  You do not have to subscribe to this theory in full,
          or at all, but you should think about what you want these values to be <i>before</i> you
          start any serious manual rating.  Note that any config value that is left commented out
          will default to the non-length-specific value.
          <p>
          See <a href="#config">Configuration</a> for details on setting rating values.
      </div>
      <div id="ratingprocess"><h3><li>The Rating Process</h3>
        <img src="./images/RateScreen1.png" alt="Rating Screen" width="700px"><p>
        The query parameters for the Rate action work <i>exactly</i> the same as with the
        Query action, with the exception that the default value for the Rating Method is
        "Auto-loaded".  This is because you are typically wanting to rate entries that have
        not yet been hand-rated.
        <p>
        <img src="./images/RatingMethod1.png" alt="Rating Method Control" width="300px"><p>
        Also, whereas a regular query returns up to 1000 entries at a time, a rating query is
        limited to 20 entries per request.  This is because rating 1000 entries at once would be a
        bit overwhelming, so breaking it into 20-entry "chunks" is more conducive to rating several
        of those chunks in a single sitting.  Also, 20 entries are easily displayed without the need
        to scroll.
        <div class="tip">Tip:<p>Hand-rating all your words can seem
          like an impossible task.  My advice, as a constructor, is to start
          small (literally).  3-letter words are the most common, so start there.
          Then do 4-letter words.  This can be a task that you can perform whenever
          you have a little free time.  Got 5 minutes?  Rate 100 words.
        </div>
        <p>
        <p>
        When a rate query has returned (up to) 20 results, they will be displayed
        in the Display Area (along with their current, auto-loaded rating).  At this point, you can
        rate them one by one using the rating buttons.  As you rate each one, it will disappear from
        the top of the list and the next entry will move up.  This allows very quick rating, as you
        need only hit a single button per word.
        <div class="tip">Tip:<p>You can add a comment to a word during the rating process.
          Simply type the comment in the "Comments" field before selecting the appropriate
           rating button.
        </div>
        <p>
        <p>
        The following screen shot is a sample result of a rating query for unrated
        words that have been in a NY Times puzzle and start with the string "TEST".  Note in the
        status bar that the query has returned the first 20 of a total of 52 entries that meet
        this criteria.
        <p>
        <img src="./images/RateScreen2.png" alt="Rating Screen" width="700px"><p>
        If, for whatever reason, you feel like you need more granularity than the rating buttons are
        providing, you can set any value (from 0 to 100) using the Manual Rating slider and
        assign it with the "Manual" button.
      </div>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>When you're filling a themed
        puzzle, there will be many spots where the fill choice is constrained by the
        theme entries (typically, down entries crossing the long theme entries).
        Use the pattern-matching feature to hand rate those
        patterns before trying to fill the grid. For example, you might need the pattern "??N??C?"
        or "?X???".
        <p>In this way, your rating activity
        is specifically targeted to the puzzle(s) you are working on, so you get
        immediate benefit.<p>I typically do this multiple times throughout my
        fill process: rate words, export to file, import new dictionary, continue
        filling. Rinse and repeat.
      </div>
      <div id="research"><h3><li>Research and Skip</h3>
        For any entry during the rating process, you can choose to skip it for now.  In this
        case, you just move on to the next word while making no changes to the skipped word.
        Both the "Skip" and "Research" buttons skip the current word; the difference between the
        two is that the "Research" button also flags the entry as needing research.  This can be
        especially useful if you are rating offline (like on an airplane) or are just focusing on
        quick and easy ratings and want to come back to certain words when you have more time and
        opportunity to look them up.
        <p>
        Words that are flagged for research will be automatically cleared of that flag once they are hand-rated.
      </div>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="load"><h2><li>Loading Word Lists</h2>
      One of the great features of this software is that is can load word lists into your dictionary
      without overwriting words and data that you have already curated.  See <a href=#reconciler>
      Understand the Reconciler</a> for details about how this works.<p>
      <div class="alert">IMPORTANT:<p>
        It is HIGHLY recommended that you backup your database before
        loading a word list.
        By backing up first, if the merge goes awry (perhaps you had the wrong parameters set,
        for example) you can <a href="#clear">clear the tables</a>, <a href="#restore">restore

      The default Rating Method value for the Load screen is "Auto-loaded". This setting covers both
      unrated <i>and</i> rated word lists,
      as the software will automatically set "ranked" for any word that is loaded <i>with</i> a value
      assigned in the word list. See LOAD_FILE_DELIMITERS in <a href="#config">Configuration</a> (or
      comments in
      the config.txt file itself) for more information about parsing ranked word lists.
      <div class="tip">Tip: <p>
      You <i>can</i> choose to load with the "Hand-rated" setting if you are
      loading an already manicured and rated list, but be certain that's what you want to do before
      proceeding as all the words in the list will be flagged as "Hand-rated" and treated as such
      during the merge (see <a href=#reconciler>Understand the Reconciler</a> for more about this).
      </div>
      <p>
      The default value for Crossword Use is "Not Used".  If you are loading a NY Times puzzle word list,
      then select "Used NYT" so all incoming words will be flagged appropriately.  Similarly, if you are
      loading a multi-puzzle word list, select "Used Any" to flag incoming entries as being used in some
      puzzle.<p>
      Note: Selecting "Used NYT" <i>implies</i> "Used Any", since the NY Times is a subset of all puzzles,
      so selecting "Used NYT" forces "Used Any" to also be selected.  Conversely, deselecting "UsedAny" will
      also deselect "Used NYT", since again you cannot specify "NYT" without also specifying "Any". Deselecting
      "Used Any" will also force "Not Used" to be selected (and vice versa), since entries either are or
      are not used -- they cannot be both nor can they be neither.
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>
        It is up to you how you want to flag your word lists. The web site
        <a href="https://www.cruciverb.com" target="_blank">
          Cruciverb.com</a> is a fantastic resource for constructors and includes, as part of its "Gold"
          membership, access to the puzzle database and two current word lists: "nyt.txt" (NY Times Puzzles)
          and "all.txt" (NY Times and other major puzzles, including LA Times, Washington Post, Boston Globe,
          Wall Street Journal, CrosSynergy Syndicate, etc.).  I use "Used NYT" when loading nyt.txt and
          "Used Any" when loading "all.txt".
      </div><p>
      The Rating slider is used to specify the default rating of any unrated words that are being loaded.
      This applies to all words if the list is unrated, but also applies to any unrated words found while
      processing a rated word list.
      <p>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>Just because a word has been used in the New York Times or other
        puzzle, does not necessarily make it a good word or desirable.  Many times a puzzle is
        accepted based on its overall quality that may have an entry or two that frankly isn't
        that good but is let slide.<p>Conversely, just because a word or phrase has NOT appeared in
        a puzzle, doesn't mean it isn't desirable.  Part of making good crosswords is finding
        those quality words and phrases that <i>haven't</i> been used yet.

          of non-alphanumeric characters and converted to all uppercase.
          <p> New entries (those that do
          not already exist in your database at the time of loading the word list) will be assigned the
          value set in the Rating slider on the Load screen.  Duplicate entries will be merged based on

          <div class="alert">IMPORTANT:<p>
            Alphanumeric characters include the letters A to Z and the numerals 0 to 9.
            <p>Please note
            that the load process will <i>not</i> attempt to convert accented or otherwise diacritically
            marked letters to their stripped form. These characters, and any other Unicode or non-ASCII
            alphanumerics, will be considered punctuation and stripped out. If you intend to load a word list

        <div id="rankwordlists"><h3><li>Ranked Word Lists</h3>
          Ranked word lists are lists of words and values, with the word and value separated (typically)
          by a ":" or ";". Note that you can add or change separator values using the LOAD_FILE_DELIMITERS
          in the config.txt file. See <a href="#config">Configuration</a> (or the comments in the
          config.txt file itself) for details.
          <p>
          As with unranked word lists, all entries, when loaded, will be stripped
          of non-alphanumeric characters and converted to all uppercase. Again, see "Important Note"
          in <a href="#unrankedwordlists">Unranked Word Lists</a>, above.
          <p> New entries (those that do
          not already exist in your database at the time of loading the word list) will be assigned the
          value set in the word list (if it exists) and marked as "ranked", else it will default to
          the value of the Rating slider on the Load screen (and <i>not</i> be marked
          as "ranked").  Duplicate entries will be merged based on
          the rules described in the <a href="#reconciler">Understanding the Reconciler</a> section.
          <p>
          <div class="alert">IMPORTANT:<p>
            Importing a ranked word list assumes values in the range of 0 to 100.
            <p>
            Any value over
            100 will be changed to 100.
            <p>Also, any value of 0 <i>will be preserved</i>, so that if
            you are importing a hand-curated list, entries that you have "killed" (assigned 0 to) will
            remain so.  This is <i>very different</i> than an entry in the list having no value (or no
            valid non-negative numeric value), in which case the entry will receive the default value for the load.<p>

        </div>
        <div id="reconciler"><h3><li>Understanding the Reconciler</h3>
          The reconciler is the heart of what allows you to import new lists without adversely affecting
          your existing dictionary.  It kicks in whenever a word loading from an "Auto-loaded" word list
          already exists in your database.  There are essentially three "tiers" of priority: hand-rated,
          rank-loaded, and auto-loaded.  See <a href="#querymethod">Rating Method Control</a> for more
          details.
          <p>
          Database fields reconcile as follows:<p>
          <dl>
            <dt><b>Rating:</b>
              <dd>A new hand-rated word's rating overrides any existing rating.
              <dd>An auto-loaded or rank-loaded word's rating will <i>not</i> override a hand-rated rating.
              <dd>A rank-loaded word (from a ranked word list) will override an existing auto-loaded rating.
              <dd>An auto-loaded word (from an unranked word list) will <i>not</i> override a rank-loaded rating.
              <dd>If both incoming and existing words are rank-loaded, the <i>lower</i> rating will prevail. This is
                done to preserve the most critical rating, which reduces "problem" words.
              <dd>If both incoming and existing words are auto-loaded, the <i>higher</i> rating will prevail. This
                is done to favor words from more "quality" sources.
            <dt><b>Rating Method:</b>
              <dd>Once a word is hand-rated, it will remain that way. The only way to clear a
                hand-rated flag is to purge the database and reload data from scratch.
              <dd>The rank-loaded flag will override the auto-loaded flag. Once a word is rank-loaded it will
                remain that way until being hand-rated.
            <dt><b>Crossword Use (NYT or Any)</b>
              <dd>A hand-rated word's setting overrides an existing word's setting.
              <dd>Otherwise, if <i>either</i> the existing <i>or</i> incoming word has either flag set, it will be
                (or remain) set. In other words, a word loading from a non-puzzle word list does not remove the
                fact that it previously came in from a puzzle word list.
            <dt><b>Needs Research:</b>
              <dd>A hand-rated word's setting overrides an existing word's setting.
              <dd>Otherwise, if <i>either</i> the existing <i>or</i> incoming word has the research flag set, it will be
                (or remain) set.
            <dt><b>Comments:</b>
              <dd>Comments are never auto-loaded. Hand-rated comments override (or remove, if deleted) existing comments.
          </dl>
          <p>
          <div class="alert">IMPORTANT:<p>
            When manually adding words, from the Add screen, or loading with the "Hand-rated" flag set,
            the metadata settings that you select <i>will override any existing metadata</i>. This
            is because "Hand-rated" is essentially a manual override and enforcing any other logic would
            make it so you could never add or clear certain flags.  Manual changes will <i>always</i> take
            precedence over any data currently in the database.
            <p>  This is also why loading word lists with
            the "Hand-rated" flag can be so dangerous, as it essentially bypasses <i>all</i> reconciling
            and treats each entry as a manual add.

      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="export"><h2><li>Exporting Word Lists</h2>
      Exporting is how you use your database to create dictionary files to be used with crossword
      construction software (e.g. Crossword Compiler or CrossFire).
      <p>
      <img src="./images/ExportScreen1.png" alt="Export Screen" width="700px"><p>
      The default parameters on this screen are to export <i>everything</i> in the database that
      has at least the minimum-specified rating. Here I use 10 as the cut-off, as anything below that
      is way too bad to even consider. Of course, your mileage may vary, as may your rating ranges.
      This default value is set as EXPORT_DEFAULT_MINIMUM_RATING in the config.txt file.
      <p>
      Enter the name of the file you want to create in the "File to Export" field. By default, this
      file will be created in the "export" directory, but this path can be manually edited (and the
      default path can be overridden in the config.txt file using the EXPORT_FILE_DEFAULT_DIR parameter).
      See <a href="#config">Configuration</a> (or the comments in the config.txt file itself) for more
      details.
      <p>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>
      CrossFire dictionaries can reside anywhere, so I export my files with names in the form
      dictYYYYMMDD.dict (where YYYYMMDD is today's date, e.g., dict20200101.dict) and then select them
      using the "browse" feature in CrossFire to load them directly in.  This way I can easily make
      rating changes and reload a new dictionary with relative ease. If I'm doing multiple iterations,
      I'll add an 'a', 'b', 'c', etc. to the file name to keep them unique (e.g., dict20200101a.dict).
      <p>
      In Crossword Compiler you can import your exported word list from the Convert menu in the Word List
      Manager.
      </div><p>
      Exported files contain one entry per line, in the format: WORD;RATING (see note,
      below), for example:
      <p>
        ANT;60<br>
        BEAR;70<br>
        ...<br>
      <p>
      <div class="note">Note:<p>
         If necessary, the delimiter between WORD and RATING can be changed by setting
      EXPORT_FILE_DELIMITER in the config.txt file.  See <a href="#config">Configuration</a> (or the
      comments in the config.txt file) for more details.

        <div id="backup"><h3><li>Backup</h3>
          The backup command takes a full backup of your database and stores it

          where "YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.SSS" is the timestamp when the backup was done.
          <p>
          <div class="alert">IMPORTANT:<p>
            It is HIGHLY recommended that you backup your database periodically,
            and especially before any major changes, such as <a href="#load">loading a
            word list</a>.
            By backing up first, if the merge goes awry (perhaps you had the wrong parameters set,

        <div id="restore"><h3><li>Restore</h3>
          To restore a backup file, select "Restore" from the Database Menu, which will bring you

          it exists.  If the "backups" directory does not exist, it is probably because you have
          never created a backup and, therefore, have nothing to restore to. A restore
          file MUST come from the "backup" directory (to prevent accidental "restoring" of non-backup files).
          <p>
          <div class="alert">IMPORTANT:<p>Do NOT click the "Load" button to do a restore.  "Load"
          will only load (and merge) word and ratings. "Restore" recreates the entire database as

          <p>
          Note that for a pristine restore, you should Clear Tables first so you are starting from
          scratch.  The restore command does not delete any records.

        <div id="clear"><h3><li>Clear Tables</h3>
          This command deletes ALL DATA from your tables.  This is useful if you have a backup file that
          you want to return to.

          <div class=alert>Important:<p>Clearing tables is a destructive action. Make sure you have your

            Note that since this is a destructive action the system will require you to enter a specific
            string into the Comment field to confirm that this action was not selected accidentally.  It
            should be virtually impossible to take this action unintentionally.
