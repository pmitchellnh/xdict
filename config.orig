# Using TEST_MODE references different DB tables, so you can experiment without risk
# of contaminating or corrupting your "real" data.  To enable TEST_MODE, uncomment
# the following line.
TEST_MODE

# Default App Size - Controls the window when it first opens.  If the default values
# do not work well or look right on your screen resolution, change it here. Values
# are in pixels.

# LOAD_FILE_DELIMITERS are the single characters that are used to separate words and
# ratings in a rated word list.  The default [:; ] means that any of the following
# formats are handled:
# COW:50
# COW;50
# COW 50
# Note that '=', '[' and ']' CANNOT be used as Loadfile delimiters, as they are
# used in the processing of this file.
LOAD_FILE_DELIMITERS=[:; ]

# EXPORT_FILE_DELIMITER is the (typically) single character that is used to separate
# words and ratings in an exported word list.  This should match the format of
# your crossword-constructing dictionary, so you can actually use your exported
# word list as a dictionary.  Crossfire uses word;rating, which is the default here.
# Note that the [] are used to contain the character and are not ignored once this
# parameter has been parsed.  As such, '=', '[' and ']' cannot be used as a value.
EXPORT_FILE_DELIMITER=[;]

# The following values are assigned to the rating buttons.
# Values can be from 0 to 100.
# It is possible, though not necessary, to assign different values to
# words between 3 and 6 letters in length.  This is to support (my personal)
# theory that shorter words are not as significant as longer words when evaluating
# a puzzle fill.  For any length-specific values that you don't choose to differentiate,
# either set it explicitly to the general value or comment it out (in which case the default
# value will be used).
