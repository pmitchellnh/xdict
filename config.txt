# LOAD_FILE_DELIMITERS are the single characters that are used to separate words and
# ratings in a rated word list.  The default [:; ] means that any of the following
# formats are handled:
# COW:50
# COW;50
# COW 50
# Note that '=', '[' and ']' CANNOT be used as Loadfile delimiters, as they are
# used in the processing of this file.
LOAD_FILE_DELIMITERS=[:; ]

# EXPORT_FILE_DELIMITER is the (typically) single character that is used to separate
# words and ratings in an exported word list.  This should match the format of
# your crossword-constructing dictionary, so you can actually use your exported
# word list as a dictionary.  Crossfire uses word;rating, which is the default here.
# Note that the [] are used to contain the character and are not ignored once this
# parameter has been parsed.  As such, '=', '[' and ']' cannot be used as a value.
EXPORT_FILE_DELIMITER=[;]
