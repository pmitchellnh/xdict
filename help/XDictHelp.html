    <div id="overview"><h2><li>Overview</h2>
        XDict is a database tool designed to facilitate the creation and maintenance of
        a crossword puzzle dictionary.  It was designed and continues to be maintained
        by a crossword puzzle constructor for his personal use, and its features are
        born from the actual needs and pains of trying to maintain word lists through
        existing crossword construction tools (Crossword Compiler, Crossfire) or other
        non-crossword-specific applications (Word, Excel, text files).
        <p>

    <div id="query"><h2><li>Querying the Database</h2>
      The query tab provides a robust query interface to view your database.
      <ol type='A'>
        <div id="queryentry"><h3><li>Entry Control</h3>
          The Entry control allows you to constrain the result to match a particular pattern
          of letters. You can specify whether you want the pattern to exactly match (Equals),
          match the beginning of (Starts with), or match anywhere in (Contains) an entry in
          your database.<p>
          Note that, while database entries are all stored in upper case, the entry field is
          not case-sensitive.
          <div class="tip">Tip:<p>
            The entry field will accept '?' or '_' characters as single-character wildcards.
            For example, an Equals query on  "a?t?d" (or "a_t_d") might match ACTED, ANTED, or APTED.
          </div>

    <div id="add"><h2><li>Adding and Modifying Words</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="rate"><h2><li>Rating Words</h2>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>You can add a comment to a word during the rating process.
        Simply type the comment in the "Comments" field before selecting the appropriate
         rating button.
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>Manually rating all your words can seem
        like an impossible task.  My advice, as a constructor, is to start
        small (literally).  3-letter words are the most common, so start there.
        Then do 4-letter words.  This can be a task that you can perform whenever
        you have a little free time.  Got 5 minutes?  Rate 100 words.
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>Here's another tip. When you're filling a themed
        puzzle, there will be many spots where the fill choice is constrained by the
        theme entries.  Use the pattern-matching feature to manually rate those
        patterns before trying to fill the grid.  In this way, your rating activity
        is specifically targeted to the puzzle(s) you are working on, so get
        immediate benefit.<p>I typically do this multiple times throughout my
        fill process: rate words, export to file, import new dictionary, continue
        filling.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="load"><h2><li>Loading Word Lists</h2>
      <div class="alert">IMPORTANT:<p>It is HIGHLY recommended that you backup your database before
        loading loading a wordlist.
        By backing up first, if the merge goes awry (perhaps you had the wrong parameters set,
        for example) you can <a href="#clear">clear the tables</a>, <a href="#restore">restore
        to your backup file</a>, and try again.
      </div>
      <div class="todo">Tip:<p>There are several online resources for ranked and unranked word lists.
        <p>
        ==> INCLUDE MORE INFO HERE
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>Just because a word has been used in the New York Times or other
        puzzle, does not necessarily make it a good word or desirable.  Many times a puzzle is
        accepted based on its overall quality that may have an entry or two that frankly isn't
        that good but is let slide.<p>Similarly, just because a word or phrase has NOT appeared in
        a puzzle, doesn't mean it isn't desirable.  Part of making good crosswords is finding
        those quality words and phrases that <i>haven't</i> been used yet.

        <div id="progressreport"><h3><li>Rating Progress Report</h3>
          The Rating Progress Report shows you how much of your database has
          been manually rated, broken down by word length. This report
          gives you a nice view into what you've accomplished and still need to.

      <ol type='A'>
        <div id="databaseinfo"><h3><li>Database Info</h3>
          The Database Info command lists your active and inactive tables, and
          how many records are in each.
        </div>
        <div id="backup"><h3><li>Backup</h3>
          The backup command takes a full backup of your database and stores it
          in the "backups" subdirectory with the name "bkup_yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.sss",
          where "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.sss" is the timestamp when the backup was done.
          <div class="alert">It is HIGHLY recommended that you backup your database periodically,
            and especially before any major changes, such as <a href="#load">loading a
            wordlist</a>.
            By backing up first, if the merge goes awry (perhaps you had the wrong parameters set,
            for example) you can <a href="#clear">clear the tables</a> and <a href="#restore">restore
              to your backup file</a>.
          </div>
          <p>
          <div class="note">Note:<p>Backups done while in TEST MODE will be named
            "bkup_TEST_yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.sss".
            Any attempt to restore a TEST MODE backup file while not in TEST MODE will result in an
            error.  This is to prevent accidental cross-contamination.
            <p>
            If you truly want to restore a TEST MODE database into your production system, rename the
            backup file to remove <thead> "_TEST" portion of the name.
            </thead>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="restore"><h3><li>Restore</h3>
          To restore a backup file, select "Restore" from the Database Menu, which will bring you
          to the "Load" tab and preset the "backup/" portion of the filename. This is because the
          file MUST come from the "backup" directory (to prevent "restoring" of non-backup files).
          Type (or cut and paste) into "File to Load" the filename of the backup file
          you want to restore, and then (again) select "Restore" from the Database menu.
          <p>
          <div class="alert">Important:<p>Do NOT click the "Load" button to do a restore.  "Load"
          will only load (and merge) word and ratings. "Restore" recreates the entire database as
          it was when the backup file was created.
          <p>
          Note that for a pristine restore, you should Clear Tables first so you are starting from
          scratch.  The restore command does not delete any records.
        </div>
        <div id="clear"><h3><li>Clear Tables</h3>
          This command deletes ALL DATA from your tables.  This is useful if you have a backup file that
          you want to return to.
          <div class=alert>Important:<p>Clearing tables is a destructive action. Make sure you have your
            data backed up first or have nothing to lose (e.g., you're still playing in TEST MODE).
            <p>
            Note that since this is a destructive action the system will require you to enter a specific
            string into the Comment field to confirm that this action was not selected accidentally.  It
            should be virtually impossible to take this action unintentionally.
