    <div id="overview"><h2><li>Overview</h2>
        XDict is a database tool designed to facilitate the creation and maintenance of
        a crossword puzzle dictionary.  It was designed and continues to be maintained
        by a crossword puzzle constructor for his personal use, and its features are
        born from the actual needs and pains of trying to maintain word lists through
        existing crossword construction tools (Crossword Compiler, Crossfire) or other
        non-crossword-specific applications (Word, Excel, text files).

        Parameters in the config.txt file can be used to customize certain parameters, as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>TEST_MODE: allows you to experiment with test tables without affecting your actual DB
          <li>APP_WIDTH and APP_HEIGHT: allows you to tweak the default size of the app when it starts
            (this can be useful if the resolution of your screen causes the UI to look suboptimal)
          <li>LOAD_FILE_DELIMITERS: allows you to specify the format of rated word lists you import
          <li>EXPORT_FILE_DELIMITER: allows you to specify the format of your exported word list/dictionary
          <li>Rating values, optionally broken down by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7+ letter words. See <a href="#rate">Rating Words</a> for more details.

      Certain actions can be done from the menu commands.  They are as follows:<p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>XDict Menu:</b> About this software.
        <li><a href="#viewmenu"><b>View Menu:</b></a> Reset parameters to the default for the selected action.

      <div id="parameters"><h3><li>Metadata Parameter Settings</h3>
      <img src="./images/Parameters.png" alt="Parameters" width="700px"><p>
        These settings are used to query on or set various metadata parameters.  Not all parameters
        are applicable in certain modes.  How each is used in each mode is discussed in detail in the
        appropriate sections.
      </div>
      <div id="actions"><h3><li>Action Buttons</h3>
      <img src="./images/Actions.png" alt="Action Buttons" width="700px"><p>
        Each action mode has different action buttons associated with it.  The default action (which
        occurs if you just hit the Enter key) at any given time is the button that is colored blue.
      </div>
      <div id="modes"><h3><li>Action Mode Tabs</h3>
      <img src="./images/ModeTabs.png" alt="Action Tabs" width="700px"><p>
      The Action Mode Tabs control the type of major action you are doing.  Each action will
      set certain default parameter values, based on how one is most likely to use that mode.
      See the sections on each action for details. The action modes are:<p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#query"><b>Query:</b></a> Find entries in your database based on specific criteria.
        <li><a href="#add"><b>Add:</b></a> Manually add, modify, and/or rate single entries to your database.
        <li><a href="#rate"><b>Rate:</b></a> Rate lists of words quickly, using preset buttons.

      </div>
      <div id="results"><h3><li>Display Area</h3>
      <img src="./images/Results.png" alt="Display Area" width="700px"><p>
        The display area is where query results and other messages are shown, and where the rating
        takes place. It becomes a scrollable region when necessary.
      </div>
      <div id="statusbar"><h3><li>Status Bar</h3>
      <img src="./images/Status.png" alt="Status Bar" width="700px"><p>
        The status bar shows the progress and status of actions.
      </div>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="query"><h2><li>Querying the Database</h2>
      <img src="./images/MainScreen.png" alt="Query Screen" width="700px"><p>
      The Query tab provides a robust query interface to view your database.  All of the metadata
      parameters can be used to constrain the query, with the exception of "Comments".  There is no
      current mechanism to query based on the contents of the Comments field.<p>
      For large queries, be aware that the system only returns up to 1000 entries per request. For
      queries that have more than 1000 entries in the result set, use the "Next" button (which will
      become the default action) to view the next 1000 entries.  You can continue using the "Next"
      action until the result set is empty. Note that your progress through the list is displayed
      in the status bar.<p>
      <img src="./images/QueryStatus1.png" alt="Query Status" width="500px"><p>
      <img src="./images/QueryStatus2.png" alt="Query Status" width="480px"><p>
      <ol type='A'>
      <div id="queryentry"><h3><li>Entry Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/EntryControl.png" alt="Entry Control" width="500px"><p>
        The Entry control allows you to constrain the result to match a particular pattern
        of letters. You can specify whether you want the pattern to exactly match (Equals),
        match the beginning of (Starts with), or match anywhere in (Contains) an entry in
        your database.<p>
        Note that, while database entries are all stored in upper case, the entry field is
        not case-sensitive.
        <div class="tip">Tip:<p>
          The entry field will accept '?' or '_' characters as single-character wildcards.
          For example, an Equals query on  "a?t?d" (or "a_t_d") might match ACTED, ANTED, or APTED.
        </div><p>
        <div class="tip">Tip:<p>
          Any query for an exact entry string (an "Equals" search of at least one character with no wildcards)
          will search for that string <i>ignoring any other parameters that may be set</i>. This is
          because when you just want to know whether a word is or is not in your database, you don't
          want to have to guess what the other parameters might or might not be.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="querylength"><h3><li>Length Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/LengthControl.png" alt="Length Control" width="500px"><p>
        The Length control allows you to constrain the result to match a particular length,
        a minimum length, or a maximum length.  The default is "at least 3", which returns
        all lengths (since the database does not store entries less than 3-letters long).
        Other examples: "At most 15" would show entries between 3- and 15-letters long, while
        "Equals 7" would show only entries that are exactly 7-letters long.
      </div>
      <div id="querymethod"><h3><li>Rating Method Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/RatingMethod.png" alt="Rating Method Control" width="300px"><p>
        The Rating Method control allows you to select just manually-rated words, just
        auto-loaded words, or both.  Auto-loaded words are words that were loaded from a
        rated or unrated word list, while manually-rated words are words that were added
        or rated via the XDict program. The default query setting is "All".<p>
        <div class="tip">Tip: You <i>can</i> designate a loading word list as
          "manually-rated", for cases where you are loading an already manicured list.
          See <a href="#load">Loading Word Lists</a> for details.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="queryrating"><h3><li>Rating Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/RatingControl.png" alt="Rating Control" width="500px"><p>
        The Rating control allows you to select only entries that are at least, at most, or
        equal to a particular rating value.  This is useful when looking for highly-rated
        words that match a particular pattern, for instance.  When in the "Rating" mode,
        it can be used to target words that are currently highly or poorly rated. The default
        setting for queries is "at least 1", which displays everything except "killed" (rating = 0)
        words.
      </div>
      <div id="queryused"><h3><li>Crossword Use Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/All.png" alt="Crossword Use Control" width="300px"><p>
        The Crossword Use control allows you to select entries based on whether they have been
        used in the New York Times crossword puzzle<sup>*</sup> (Used NYT) or other "major" crossword puzzles<sup>*</sup>
        (Used Any). The default for queries is all entries. The possible combinations are as follows (though
        not all are necessarily useful):
        <p>
        <sup>*</sup>Assuming you have captured this data -- see "Tip" below!
        <ul>
          <li><img src="./images/All.png" alt="all" width="200px"> All entries.
          <li><img src="./images/Any.png" alt="any" width="200px"> Entries used in any puzzle.
          <li><img src="./images/NYT.png" alt="nyt" width="200px"> Entries used in NY Times puzzle.
          <li><img src="./images/NotUsed.png" alt="not used" width="200px"> Entries not used in any puzzle.
          <li><img src="./images/NotNYT.png" alt="not nyt" width="200px"> Entries not used in a NY Times puzzle.
          <li><img src="./images/Other.png" alt="other" width="200px"> Entries not used in NY Times, but used in some puzzle.
          <li><img src="./images/NotOther.png" alt="not other" width="200px">Entries used in NY Times or not at all.
          <li><img src="./images/None.png" alt="none" width="200px">No entries.
        </ul>
        <p>
        <div class="tip">Tip: These fields are set when you add (manually) or load word lists, so
          in order to use them effectively, you must make sure to set the "Used_NYT" field when importing
          NY Times wordlists and the "Used_Any" field when importing other crossword puzzle lists.
          See <a href="#load">Loading Word Lists</a> for details.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="queryresearch"><h3><li>Needs Research Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/Research.png" alt="Research Control" width="200px"><p>
        This field is used to select entries that you flagged as "Research" during the rating process.
        Note that this constraint is in addition to any other fields that are set, so to get a complete
        list of entries that need to be researched, use the "Reset Query" action in the "View" menu
        before querying with this field.
        <p>
        See <a href="#ratingprocess">The Rating Process</a> for more on using the "Research" field.
      </div>
      <div id="querycomment"><h3><li>Comment Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/Comment.png" alt="Comment Control" width="700px"><p>
        This field is not used as a selection criteria.  However, any query that results in a single
        entry will display that entry's comment in this field (if there is one).
      </div>
      <div id="querybutton"><h3><li>Query and Next Buttons</h3>
        Pressing the "Query" button (or hitting enter when the button is blue) executes a query based
        on the metadata parameters set, as described above. <p>
        <img src="./images/Query1.png" alt="Query and Next Buttons" width="200px"><p>
        For queries that result in more than 1000
        entries, only the first 1000 will be returned, after which the "Next" button (which will now
        become enabled and also become the default action) will fetch the next 1000, and so on until there
        are no more entries that satisfy the criteria.<p>
        <img src="./images/Query2.png" alt="Query and Next Buttons" width="200px"><p>
        Note that any time the "Query" button is used, the
        query will start again from scratch.  Also, changing <i>any</i> of the metadata criteria will
        disable the "Next" button and only allow a fresh query using the new parameters.
        <p>
        See <a href="#ratingprocess">The Rating Process</a> for more on using the "Research" field.
      </div>
      <div id="queryoutput"><h3><li>Query Output Display</h3>
        The query output displays the results of the query (up to 1000 entries at a time, scrollable).
        The format for each entry is as follows:
        <p>
        WORD(LENGTH), RATING [, any] [, nyt] [, research] [,manual] [(COMMENT)]
        <p>
          where the fields in [] only appear if set.  For example, a "bare minimum" auto-loaded entry would
          display as follows (just WORD(LENGTH), RATING):
        <p>
          <img src="./images/QueryResult2.png" alt="Sample Query Result" width="400px"><p>
          whereas, an entry with all possible fields set would display like this:
          <p>
            <img src="./images/QueryResult1.png" alt="Sample Query Result" width="400px"><p>
          indicating that the entry is flagged as having been used in puzzles, including the NY Times,
          that it is flagged as needing research, that it has been manually rated, and that it has a
          comment, which is displayed in parentheses.  Note that this example is for clarity only -- it
          would be unusual for both "research" and "manual" to be set on the same word, though it could
          happen if you chose to revisit a previously rated entry.
      </div>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="add"><h2><li>Adding and Modifying Words</h2>
      <img src="./images/AddScreen1.png" alt="Add Screen" width="700px"><p>
      The Add tab allow you to quickly add or modify (and rate) single entries in your database. When
      adding a new word manually, you have no choice but to mark it "Hand-rated".  Likewise, you cannot
      specify the length, as that will be calculated after the word is cleared of all non-alphanumeric
      characters and converted to uppercase.  The default value for the Crossword Use control is "Not Used",
      as typically that is the case when adding new words manually, but you can change these values, add
      a comment, and select or designate a rating value (default preset is "OK"), by setting them on the
      screen before pressing the "Add" button.
      <p>
      Note that, unlike in the Rating process, pressing a rating button will <i>not</i> immediately cause
      the word to be added.  The rating buttons are a convenience to set the Manual Slider based on
      your rating scale.  No action to the database will occur until you press the "Add" button. Once the
      word is added, it will display the formatted word and rating in the Display Area.

      Adding an entry that already exists will not fail; it will modify the existing word with the parameters
      specified.  See "Important Tip" below.
      <div class="alert">Important Tip: <p>
      It is a <b>very good</b> idea to first query directly for the entry to see if already exists.  Doing so and
      then switching <i>directly</i> to the Add screen will
      preserve the Entry and Comment fields, as well as preload the appropriate Crossword
      Use fields. It will also preset the current rating into the Manual Rating slider of the Add screen.<p>
      If you go to the add field directly and the entry already exists, you risk overwriting existing
      information when the record is modified.

    <div id="rate"><h2><li>Rating Words</h2>
      <ol type='A'>
      <div id="ratingoverview"><h3><li>Overview and Theory</h3>
        A lot of thought has been put into how to rate words quickly, efficiently,
        and intuitively.  Rating words is certainly not an exact science -- different
        people have different ideas about what determines the quality of an entry.
        Even one's own judgement may be inconsistent from day to day, based on mood
        or interpretation of a given entry.  This is especially true if one is assigning
        numerical scores.  As such, this software pushes the numerical values into the
        background (after being preset through configuration), allowing the user (you)
        to rate based entirely on your perception of the entry.  It does this by offering
        seven possible ratings<sup>*</sup> for each word, as follows:<p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Excellent:</b> These are marquee entries that you would go out of your way to use.
          <li><b>Good:</b> These are solid words and phrases that you would be happy to use.
          <li><b>OK:</b> These are common words and phrases that may lack pizzazz, but there's nothing wrong with them.
          <li><b>Lame:</b> These are words and phrases that you know you'll need, but want to minimize. I include
            most abbreviations, foreign words, and fill-in-the-blank partials in this category.
          <li><b>Poor:</b> These are obscure entries that you would normally avoid, but could resort to in a pinch.
          <li><b>Terrible:</b> These are actual words or phrases that you would probably never want to use.
            I include super-scientific terms, obscure variations, and profanity in this category.
          <li><b>Kill:</b> This is used for non-words.  Sometimes a sequence of letters shows up in a
            word list from a rebus, a backwards entry, or some other quirky puzzle that was not filtered out.
            Killing it gives it a 0 value.
        </ul><p>
        <sup>*</sup>The rating values can vary by word length; see below. You can also rate a word manually,
        if you need more granularity for a given word.
        <p>
          <b>My theory on word length:</b> <p>
          I don't think it's a stretch to say that long entries carry a puzzle.  That is not to say that
          shorter entries are unimportant; they certainly matter.  But the long entries are the ones
          that your solvers (and editors) are going to notice.  Put another way, good long entries are
          better than good short entries, and bad long entries are worse than bad short entries. There
          is not a 3-letter entry in existence that is so good that it can make up for a bad long entry.
          It is not a huge exaggeration to say that almost any 3-letter entry could be justified in a
          pinch. To put it in mathematical terms, the standard deviation for long entries should, in my
          opinion, be considerably larger than for short entries.<p>
          This is why this software allows for the configuration of separate rating values for entries
          that are 3, 4, 5, and 6 letters long.  You do not have to subscribe to this theory in full,
          or at all, but you should think about what you want these values to be <i>before</i> you
          start any serious manual rating.  Note that any config value that is left commented out
          will default to the non-length-specific value.
      </div>
      <div id="ratingprocess"><h3><li>The Rating Process</h3>
        <img src="./images/RateScreen1.png" alt="Rating Screen" width="700px"><p>
        The query parameters for the Rate action work <i>exactly</i> the same as with the
        Query action, with the exception that the default value for the Rating Method is
        "Auto-loaded".  This is because you are typically wanting to rate entries that have
        not yet been manually rated.
        <p>
        <img src="./images/RatingMethod1.png" alt="Rating Method Control" width="300px"><p>
        Also, whereas a regular query returns up to 1000 entries at a time, a rating query is
        limited to 20 entries per request.  This is because rating 1000 entries at once would be a
        bit overwhelming, so breaking it into 20-entry "chunks" is more conducive to rating several
        of those chunks in a single sitting.  Also, 20 entries are easily displayed without the need
        to scroll.
        <div class="tip">Tip:<p>Manually rating all your words can seem
          like an impossible task.  My advice, as a constructor, is to start
          small (literally).  3-letter words are the most common, so start there.
          Then do 4-letter words.  This can be a task that you can perform whenever
          you have a little free time.  Got 5 minutes?  Rate 100 words.
        </div>
        <p>
        <p>
        When a rate query has returned (up to) 20 results, they will be displayed
        in the Display Area (along with their current, auto-loaded rating).  At this point, you can
        rate them one by one using the rating buttons.  As you rate each one, it will disappear from
        the top of the list and the next entry will move up.  This allows very quick rating, as you
        need only hit a single button per word.
        <div class="tip">Tip:<p>You can add a comment to a word during the rating process.
          Simply type the comment in the "Comments" field before selecting the appropriate
           rating button.
        </div>
        <p>
        <p>
        The following screen shot is a sample result of a rating query for unrated
        words that have been in a NY Times puzzle and start with the string "TEST".  Note in the
        status bar that the query has returned the first 20 of a total of 52 entries that meet
        this criteria.
        <p>
        <img src="./images/RateScreen2.png" alt="Rating Screen" width="700px"><p>
        If, for whatever reason, you feel like you need more granularity than the rating buttons are
        providing, you can set any value (from 0 to 100) using the Manual Rating slider and
        assign it with the "Manual" button.
      </div>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>Here's another tip. When you're filling a themed
        puzzle, there will be many spots where the fill choice is constrained by the
        theme entries (typically, down entries crossing the long theme entries).
        Use the pattern-matching feature to manually rate those
        patterns before trying to fill the grid.  In this way, your rating activity
        is specifically targeted to the puzzle(s) you are working on, so you get
        immediate benefit.<p>I typically do this multiple times throughout my
        fill process: rate words, export to file, import new dictionary, continue
        filling. Rinse and repeat.
      </div>
      <div id="research"><h3><li>Research and Skip</h3>
        For any entry during the rating process, you can choose to skip it for now.  In this
        case, you just move on to the next word while making no changes to the skipped word.
        Both the "Skip" and "Research" buttons skip the current word; the difference between the
        two is that the "Research" button also flags the entry as needing research.  This can be
        especially useful if you are rating offline (like on an airplane) or are just focusing on
        quick and easy ratings and want to come back to certain words when you have more time and
        opportunity to look them up.
        <p>
        Words that are flagged for research will be cleared of that flag once they are manually
        rated.
      </div>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="load"><h2><li>Loading Word Lists</h2>
      One of the great features of this program is that is can load word lists into your dictionary
      without overwriting words and data that you have already curated.  See <a href=#reconciler>
      Understand the Reconciler</a> for details about how this works.<p>
      <div class="alert">IMPORTANT:<p>It is HIGHLY recommended that you backup your database before
        loading a wordlist.
        By backing up first, if the merge goes awry (perhaps you had the wrong parameters set,
        for example) you can <a href="#clear">clear the tables</a>, <a href="#restore">restore
        to your backup file</a>, and try again.
      </div>
      <p>
      The default Rating Method value for the Load screen is "Auto-loaded", as you are loading a
      file of (typically) uncurated words.  You <i>can</i> change this to "Hand-rated" if you are
      loading an already manicured and rated list, but be certain that's what you want to do before
      proceeding as all the words in the list will be flagged as "Hand-rated" and treated as such
      during the merge (see <a href=#reconciler>Understand the Reconciler</a> for more about this).
      <p>
      The default value for Crossword Use is "Not Used".  If you are loading a NY Times puzzle wordlist,
      then select "Used NYT" so all incoming words will be flagged appropriately.  Similarly, if you are
      loading a multi-puzzle wordlist, select "Used Any" to flag incoming entries as being used in some
      puzzle.<p>
      Note: Selecting "Used NYT" <i>implies</i> "Used Any", since the NY Times is a subset of all puzzles,
      so selecting "Used NYT" forces "Used Any" to also be selected.  Conversely, deselecting "UsedAny" will
      also deselect "Used NYT", since again you cannot specify "NYT" without also specifying "Any".
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>
        It is up to you how you want to flag your wordlists. The web site
        <a href="https://www.cruciverb.com" target="_blank">
          Cruciverb.com</a> is a fantastic resource for constructors and includes, as part of its "Gold"
          membership, access to the puzzle database and two current wordlists: "nyt.txt" (NY Times Puzzles)
          and "all.txt" (NY Times and other major puzzles, including LA Times, Washington Post, Boston Globe,
          Wall Street Journal, CrosSynergy Syndicate, etc.).  I use "Used NYT" when loading nyt.txt and
          "Used Any" when loading "all.txt".
      </div><p>
      The Rating slider is used to specify the default rating of any unrated words that are being loaded.
      This applies to all words if the list is unrated, but also applies to any unrated words found while
      processing a rated word list.
      <p>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>Just because a word has been used in the New York Times or other
        puzzle, does not necessarily make it a good word or desirable.  Many times a puzzle is
        accepted based on its overall quality that may have an entry or two that frankly isn't
        that good but is let slide.<p>Similarly, just because a word or phrase has NOT appeared in
        a puzzle, doesn't mean it isn't desirable.  Part of making good crosswords is finding
        those quality words and phrases that <i>haven't</i> been used yet.
      </div><p>
      To load a word list, specify the path and file name of the word list (relative to where the XDict
      program is running), make sure the parameters are set the way you want them (including the default
      rating value) and press the "Load" action button.

        <div id="unrankedwordlists"><h3><li>Unranked Word Lists</h3>
          Unranked word lists are simply lists of words and phrases, one entry per line. It
          makes no difference whether the lists are in upper-, lower-, or mixed-case, nor whether
          they include punctuation marks (see Important Note, below).  All entries, when loaded, will be stripped
          of non-alphanumeric characters and converted to all uppercase.
          <p> New entries (those that do
          not already exist in your database at the time of loading the wordlist) will be assigned the
          value set in the Rating slider on the Load screen.  Duplicate entries will be merged based on
          the rules described in the <a href="#reconciler">Understanding the Reconciler</a> section.
          <p>
          <div class="alert">Important Note:<p>
            Alphanumeric characters include the letters A to Z and the numerals 0 to 9. Please note
            that the load process will <b>not</b> attempt to convert accented or otherwise diacritically
            marked letters to their stripped form. These characters, and any other Unicode or non-ASCII
            alphanumerics, will be considered punctuation and stripped out. If you intend to load a word list
            that has these characters, you will need to make any letter conversions manually before you load
            the list.

        <div id="rankwordlists"><h3><li>Ranked Word Lists</h3>
          Ranked word lists are lists of words and values, with the word and value separated (typically)

          in the config.txt file. See <a href="#config">Configuration</a> (or the comments in the
