    <div id="overview"><h2><li>Overview</h2>
        XDict is a database tool designed to facilitate the creation and maintenance of
        a crossword puzzle dictionary.  It was designed and continues to be maintained
        by a crossword puzzle constructor for his personal use, and its features are
        born from the actual needs and pains of trying to maintain word lists through
        existing crossword construction tools (Crossword Compiler, Crossfire) or other
        non-crossword-specific applications (Word, Excel, text files).

      <div id="modes"><h3><li>Action Mode Tabs</h3>
      <img src="./images/xdict02.png" alt="Action Tabs"><p>
      The Action Mode Tabs control the type of major action you are doing.  Each action will
      enable and disable certain UI elements and will set certain default values.  See the sections
      on each action for details. The major actions are:<p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#query"><b>Query:</b></a> Find entries in your database based on specific criteria.
        <li><a href="#add"><b>Add:</b></a> Manually add and rate new entries to your database.

    </div>
    <div id="query"><h2><li>Querying the Database</h2>
      The query tab provides a robust query interface to view your database.
      <ol type='A'>
      <div id="queryentry"><h3><li>Entry Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/xdict04.png" alt="Entry Control"><p>
        The Entry control allows you to constrain the result to match a particular pattern
        of letters. You can specify whether you want the pattern to exactly match (Equals),
        match the beginning of (Starts with), or match anywhere in (Contains) an entry in
        your database.<p>
        Note that, while database entries are all stored in upper case, the entry field is
        not case-sensitive.
        <div class="tip">Tip:<p>
          The entry field will accept '?' or '_' characters as single-character wildcards.
          For example, an Equals query on  "a?t?d" (or "a_t_d") might match ACTED, ANTED, or APTED.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="querylength"><h3><li>Length Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/xdict05.png" alt="Length Control"><p>
        The Length control allows you to constrain the result to match a particular length,
        a minimum length, or a maximum length.  The default is "at least 3", which returns
        all lengths (since the database does not store entries less than 3-letters long).
        Other examples: "At most 15" would show entries between 3- and 15-letters long, while
        "Equals 7" would show only entries that are exactly 7-letters long.
      </div>
      <div id="querymethod"><h3><li>Rating Method Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/xdict06.png" alt="Rating Method Control"><p>
        The Rating Method control allows you to select just manually-rated words, just
        auto-loaded words, or both.  Auto-loaded words are words that were loaded from a
        rated or unrated word list, while manually-rated words are words that were added
        or rated via the XDict program<sup>*</sup>.<p>
        <div class="note"><sup>*</sup>Note: You <i>can</i> designate a loading word list as
          "manually-rated", for cases where you are loading an already manicured list.
          See <a href="#load">Loading Word Lists</a> for details.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="queryrating"><h3><li>Rating Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/xdict07.png" alt="Rating Control"><p>
        The Rating control allows you to select only entries that are at least, at most, or
        equal to a particular rating value.  This is useful when looking for highly-rated
        words that match a particular pattern, for instance.  When in the "Rating" mode,
        it can be used to target words that are currently highly or poorly rated. The default
        value for queries is "at least 1", which displays everything except "killed" (rating = 0)
        words.
      </div>
      <div id="queryused"><h3><li>Crossword Use Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/xdict08.png" alt="Crossword Use Control"><p>
        The Crossword Use control allows you to select entries based on whether they have been
        used in the New York Times crossword puzzle<sup>*</sup> (UsedNYT) or other "major" crossword puzzles<sup>*</sup>
        (UsedAny). The possible combinations are as follows (though not all are necessarily useful):
        <p>
        <sup>*</sup>Assuming you have captured this data -- see "Tip" below!
        <ul>
          <li><img src="./images/All.png" alt="all" width="250px"> All entries.
          <li><img src="./images/NotUsed.png" alt="not used" width="250px"> Entries not used in any puzzles.
          <li><img src="./images/NYT.png" alt="nyt" width="250px"> Entries used in NY Times puzzles.
          <li><img src="./images/Any.png" alt="any" width="250px"> Entries used in some puzzle, including the NY Times.
          <li><img src="./images/NotNYT.png" alt="not nyt" width="250px"> Entries not used in a NY Times puzzle.
          <li><img src="./images/Other.png" alt="other" width="250px"> Entries used in some puzzle, but not NY Times.
          <li><img src="./images/NotOther.png" alt="not other" width="250px">Entries used in NY Times or not at all.
          <li><img src="./images/None.png" alt="none" width="250px">No selections will return no data.
        </ul>
        <p>
        <div class="tip">Tip: These fields are set when you add (manually) or load word lists, so
          in order to use them effectively, you must make sure to set the "Used_NYT" field when importing
          NY Times wordlists and the "Used_Any" field when importing other crossword puzzle lists.
          See <a href="#load">Loading Word Lists</a> for details.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="queryresearch"><h3><li>Research Control</h3>
        <img src="./images/xdict09.png" alt="Research Control"><p>
        This field is used to select entries that you flagged as "Research" during the rating process.
        Note that this constraint is in addition to any other fields that are set, so to get a complete
        list of entries that need to be researched, use the "Reset Query" action in the "View" menu
        before selecting this field.

      <ol type='A'>
      <div id="ratingoverview"><h3><li>Overview and Theory</h3>
        A lot of thought has been put into how to rate words quickly, efficiently,
        and intuitively.  Rating words is certainly not an exact science -- different
        people have different ideas about what determines the quality of an entry.
        Even one's own judgement may be inconsistent from day to day, based on mood
        or interpretation of a given entry.  This is especially true if one is assigning
        numerical scores.  As such, this software pushes the numerical values into the
        background (after being preset through configuration), allowing the user (you)
        to rate based entirely on your perception of the entry.  It does this by offering
        seven possible ratings<sup>*</sup> for each word, as follows:<p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Excellent:</b> These are marquee entries that you would go out of your way to use.
          <li><b>Good:</b> These are solid words and phrases that you would be happy to use.
          <li><b>OK:</b> These are common words and phrases that may lack pizzazz, but there's nothing wrong with them.
          <li><b>Lame:</b> These are words and phrases that you know you'll need, but want to minimize. I include
            most abbreviations, foreign words, and fill-in-the-blank partials in this category.
          <li><b>Poor:</b> These are obscure entries that you would normally avoid, but could resort to in a pinch.
          <li><b>Terrible:</b> These are actual words or phrases that you would probably never want to use.
            I include super-scientific terms, obscure variations, and profanity in this category.
          <li><b>Kill:</b> This is used for non-words.  Sometimes a sequence of letters shows up in a
            word list from a rebus, a backwards entry, or some other quirky puzzle that was not filtered out.
            Killing it gives it a 0 value.
        </ul><p>
        <sup>*</sup>The rating values can vary by word length; see below. You can also rate a word manually.
        <p>
          <b>My theory on word length:</b> <p>
          I don't think it's a stretch to say that long entries carry a puzzle.  That is not to say that
          shorter entries are unimportant; they certainly matter.  But the long entries are the ones
          that your solvers (and editors) are going to notice.  Put another way, good long entries are
          better than good short entries, and bad long entries are worse than bad short entries. There
          is not a 3-letter entry in existence that is so good that it can make up for a bad long entry.
          It is not a huge exaggeration to say that almost any 3-letter entry could be justified in a
          pinch. To put it in mathematical terms, the standard deviation for long entries should, in my
          opinion, be considerably larger than for short entries.<p>
          This is why this software allows for the configuration of separate rating values for entries
          that are 3, 4, 5, and 6 letters long.  You do not have to subscribe to this theory in full,
          or at all, but you should think about what you want these values to be <i>before</i> you
          start any serious manual rating.  Note that any config value that is left commented out
          will default to the non-length-specific value.
      </div>
      <div id="ratingprocess"><h3><li>The Rating Process</h3>

      </div>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>You can add a comment to a word during the rating process.
        Simply type the comment in the "Comments" field before selecting the appropriate
         rating button.
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>Manually rating all your words can seem
        like an impossible task.  My advice, as a constructor, is to start
        small (literally).  3-letter words are the most common, so start there.
        Then do 4-letter words.  This can be a task that you can perform whenever
        you have a little free time.  Got 5 minutes?  Rate 100 words.
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>Here's another tip. When you're filling a themed
        puzzle, there will be many spots where the fill choice is constrained by the
        theme entries.  Use the pattern-matching feature to manually rate those
        patterns before trying to fill the grid.  In this way, your rating activity
        is specifically targeted to the puzzle(s) you are working on, so get
        immediate benefit.<p>I typically do this multiple times throughout my
        fill process: rate words, export to file, import new dictionary, continue
        filling.

    <div id="load"><h2><li>Loading Word Lists</h2>
      <div class="alert">IMPORTANT:<p>It is HIGHLY recommended that you backup your database before

      <div class="tip">Tip:<p>Just because a word has been used in the New York Times or other
        puzzle, does not necessarily make it a good word or desirable.  Many times a puzzle is

        that good but is let slide.<p>Similarly, just because a word or phrase has NOT appeared in
        a puzzle, doesn't mean it isn't desirable.  Part of making good crosswords is finding
        those quality words and phrases that <i>haven't</i> been used yet.

            and especially before any major changes, such as <a href="#load">loading a
            wordlist</a>.
            By backing up first, if the merge goes awry (perhaps you had the wrong parameters set,
            for example) you can <a href="#clear">clear the tables</a> and <a href="#restore">restore
              to your backup file</a>.
          </div>
          <p>
          <div class="note">Note:<p>Backups done while in TEST MODE will be named
            "bkup_TEST_yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.sss".
            Any attempt to restore a TEST MODE backup file while not in TEST MODE will result in an
            error.  This is to prevent accidental cross-contamination.
            <p>
            If you truly want to restore a TEST MODE database into your production system, rename the
            backup file to remove <thead> "_TEST" portion of the name.

          To restore a backup file, select "Restore" from the Database Menu, which will bring you
          to the "Load" tab and preset the "backup/" portion of the filename. This is because the
          file MUST come from the "backup" directory (to prevent "restoring" of non-backup files).
          Type (or cut and paste) into "File to Load" the filename of the backup file
          you want to restore, and then (again) select "Restore" from the Database menu.
          <p>
          <div class="alert">Important:<p>Do NOT click the "Load" button to do a restore.  "Load"
          will only load (and merge) word and ratings. "Restore" recreates the entire database as
          it was when the backup file was created.
          <p>
          Note that for a pristine restore, you should Clear Tables first so you are starting from
          scratch.  The restore command does not delete any records.
        </div>
        <div id="clear"><h3><li>Clear Tables</h3>
          This command deletes ALL DATA from your tables.  This is useful if you have a backup file that
          you want to return to.
          <div class=alert>Important:<p>Clearing tables is a destructive action. Make sure you have your
            data backed up first or have nothing to lose (e.g., you're still playing in TEST MODE).
            <p>
            Note that since this is a destructive action the system will require you to enter a specific
            string into the Comment field to confirm that this action was not selected accidentally.  It
            should be virtually impossible to take this action unintentionally.
